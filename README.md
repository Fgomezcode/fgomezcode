## Felipe Gomez Villalobos

I am a computer science student at the University of California of Irvine, and I currently work as an IT Technician at a local tech company. I like to spend my free time learning about IoT and 3D printing.
I enjoy  CAD design, making IoT devices and I am currently focused on developing devices and applications for my portfolio. I really like making devices that automate repetitive tasks, provide a service and that can be accessed remotely. Since most of my projects involve some aspect of internet connectivity I have decided to learn web development while finishing my last year at UCI.
